## Phase 1: Authentication Gate

**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-02-11

### What Was Done
- Voice search button is now gated behind authentication
- Unauthenticated users see a disabled button with tooltip: "Sign in to use voice search"
- Authenticated users experience no change — voice search works as before
- Manual search filters remain available to all users (no gating)
- Edge case handled: logging out during an active voice session stops it immediately

### Files Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/components/VoiceSearchButton.tsx` | Added `disabled` and `disabledReason` props |
| `src/pages/Rentals.tsx` | Added auth check, passes disabled state to voice button |

### Build Status
- TypeScript: PASS
- Vite build: PASS

### Detailed Handoff
See `handoffs/phase1-handoff.md` for full technical details, rollback plan, and code diffs.
