## Project Management — GitHub Issues & Milestones (MANDATORY)

### Source of Truth (in priority order)
1. **GitHub Issues & Milestones** — what to work on, current status, backlog
2. **docs/PROJECT-HUB.md** — architectural decisions, session context, agent instructions
3. **docs/COMPLETED-PHASES.md** — detailed technical record of completed work

### At the START of every session
1. List open issues in the current milestone:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --repo rent-a-vacation/rav-website --state open --label "pre-launch"
   ```
2. Read `docs/PROJECT-HUB.md` for architectural context and decisions
3. Confirm with the user which issue to work on before starting any code

### At the END of every session
1. Close completed issues with a summary comment:
   ```bash
   gh issue close <number> --repo rent-a-vacation/rav-website --comment "Completed: [brief summary of what was built]"
   ```
2. Create new issues for anything discovered during the session (bugs, ideas, follow-up work)
3. Update `docs/PROJECT-HUB.md` with any architectural decisions made
4. Do NOT update PROJECT-HUB.md priority queue — GitHub Issues is now the source for priorities

### Issue lifecycle
- **New idea** → create issue with `idea` label, no milestone (Backlog)
- **Ready to work** → add milestone, move to `Ready`
- **In progress** → add `in-progress` label
- **Done** → close issue with summary comment

### Creating issues during a session
```bash
# Bug discovered
gh issue create --repo rent-a-vacation/rav-website \
  --title "Bug: [description]" \
  --label "bug,platform" \
  --body "[What's broken, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual]"

# Enhancement identified
gh issue create --repo rent-a-vacation/rav-website \
  --title "[Feature name]" \
  --label "enhancement,pre-launch,marketplace" \
  --milestone "Phase 20: Accounting & Tax" \
  --body "[What needs to be built and why]"
```

### What stays in PROJECT-HUB.md
- KEY DECISIONS LOG (DEC-XXX entries)
- Architecture notes and technical decisions

| `idea` | Unvalidated concept |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code quality, no behavior change |
| `marketplace` | Bidding, listings, booking engine |
| `platform` | Auth, payments, infra, admin |
| `experience` | UI, voice, mobile, discovery |
| `pre-launch` | Required before public launch |
| `post-launch` | Can wait until after launch |
| `blocked` | Waiting on something |
| `needs-decision` | Requires human decision before proceeding |

## Content Accuracy (MANDATORY)

All content in the codebase must reflect verified, accurate data. Never use placeholder or estimated figures.

### Verified facts (do not change without confirmation)
- **Commission rate:** 15% (not 10%)
- **Resort count:** 117 (Hilton 62, Marriott 40, Disney 15)
- **Voice quota:** Tier-based — Free: 5/day, Plus/Pro: 25/day, Premium/Business: unlimited (not flat 10/day)
- **App version:** v0.9.0 (visible in footer)

### Before updating any statistic or business metric
1. Check `docs/PROJECT-HUB.md` KEY DECISIONS LOG
2. Check `docs/COMPLETED-PHASES.md` for when it was last verified
3. If uncertain, flag with `needs-decision` label and ask the user

---

## Flow Manifest Convention (MANDATORY)

The application uses declarative **Flow Manifests** in `src/flows/` to auto-generate interactive architecture diagrams at `/architecture`. This keeps system documentation synchronized with code without manual Mermaid authoring.

### When to update manifests

You MUST update the relevant manifest in `src/flows/` when:

1. **Adding a new route** in `App.tsx` → Add a step to the appropriate lifecycle manifest
2. **Adding a new page/component** that represents a user-facing workflow step
3. **Adding conditional business logic** (status checks, approval gates) → Add `branches` to the relevant step
4. **Adding a new edge function** → Add it to the `edgeFunctions` array on the relevant step
5. **Adding/modifying database tables** → Update the `tables` array on affected steps

### Manifest structure

Flow manifests live in `src/flows/` with this structure:

```
src/flows/
├── types.ts              # FlowDefinition, FlowStep, FlowBranch types + flowToMermaid()
├── owner-lifecycle.ts    # Property Owner Journey (signup → payout)
├── traveler-lifecycle.ts # Traveler Journey (browse → check-in)
├── admin-lifecycle.ts    # RAV Admin Operations (approvals → financials)
└── index.ts              # Re-exports all flows + allFlows array
```

### Adding a step — example

When adding a new "Verification" step to the owner lifecycle:

```typescript
// In src/flows/owner-lifecycle.ts, add to the steps array:
{
  id: 'new_step_id',
  route: '/the-route',
  label: 'Human-Readable Label',
  component: 'ComponentName',
  tab: 'optional-tab',
  roles: ['property_owner'],
  description: 'What this step does',
  tables: ['affected_tables'],
  edgeFunctions: ['edge-function-name'],
  branches: [
    { condition: 'If approved', targetStepId: 'next_step_id', label: 'Approved' },
    { condition: 'If rejected', targetStepId: 'previous_step_id', label: 'Rejected', edgeStyle: 'dashed' },
  ],
}
```

### Adding a new flow

If creating an entirely new user journey:

1. Create `src/flows/new-flow-name.ts` exporting a `FlowDefinition`
2. Add it to `src/flows/index.ts` in the `allFlows` array
3. The `/architecture` page auto-renders it — no other changes needed

### Schema reference

See `src/flows/types.ts` for the complete TypeScript interfaces:
- `FlowDefinition` — a complete user journey
- `FlowStep` — a single step with route, component, tables, branches
- `FlowBranch` — a conditional edge between steps

### What NOT to do

- ❌ Do NOT hand-author Mermaid strings — the `flowToMermaid()` function generates them
- ❌ Do NOT modify `/architecture` page for content — it reads from manifests
- ❌ Do NOT skip manifest updates when adding routes — the diagram will have orphan gaps

---

## Git Branching & Deployment (MANDATORY)

### Branch Strategy: `dev` → `main`

```
feature/* (optional)
    ↓ PR
  dev   →  Vercel Preview Deploy  →  Supabase DEV
    ↓ PR (release)
  main  →  Vercel Production      →  Supabase PROD
```

### Rules

- **`dev`** is the working branch. All new code goes here first.
- **`main`** is the production branch. Protected — requires PR + 1 review + CI passing.
- **Never push directly to `main`**. Always create a PR from `dev` (or a feature branch).
- Feature branches are optional for small changes but recommended for larger work.
- Local `.env.local` points to **Supabase DEV**.
- Vercel production points to **Supabase PROD**.

### Workflow

1. Work locally on `dev` (or a feature branch off `dev`)
2. Push to `dev` → Vercel creates a preview deploy → test against Supabase DEV
3. When ready for production: create PR `dev` → `main`
4. PR requires: CI passing + 1 approval
5. Merge to `main` → auto-deploys to production

### Commit message format

```
type(scope): description

feat(auth): add user approval system
fix(voice): correct quota display for tier-based limits
docs(hub): update PROJECT-HUB after session 17
test(booking): add payment flow integration tests
chore(deps): update supabase client to v2.x
```

---

## Testing (MANDATORY)

### Tests-With-Features Policy

**Every feature or bug fix MUST include corresponding tests.** This is non-negotiable.

When building a new feature or fixing a bug, you MUST:

1. **Write tests alongside the code** — not as a separate follow-up task
2. **At minimum, test:**
   - Any new function in `src/lib/` (pure unit tests — highest ROI)
   - Any new hook in `src/hooks/` (mock Supabase, test logic branches)
   - Any new context method (extend existing context tests)
   - Any new edge function's corresponding frontend integration (mutation hooks)
3. **What to cover:**
   - Happy path + at least one error case
   - Edge cases for financial calculations (pricing, fees, commissions, refunds)
   - Conditional logic branches (role checks, status checks, date comparisons)
4. **Before committing, verify** the test count has increased if new logic was added

### Pre-commit checklist

```
✅ New functions in src/lib/ have unit tests?
✅ New hooks have integration tests?
✅ New context methods have test cases in the context test file?
✅ Financial calculations have edge-case coverage?
✅ npm run test passes?
✅ npm run build passes?
```

### Rules for every code change

1. **Run tests before committing:**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Never commit if tests fail** — fix tests first, or explicitly discuss with user
3. **Add tests for new business logic** — especially anything in `src/lib/`

### Test file locations

```
src/lib/*.test.ts              # Unit tests for pure functions
src/hooks/*.test.ts            # Integration tests for hooks
src/hooks/**/__tests__/*.ts    # Integration tests for nested hooks
src/contexts/*.test.tsx        # Integration tests for contexts
e2e/smoke/                     # Playwright E2E smoke tests
e2e/visual/                    # Percy visual regression tests
```

### Test helpers

```
src/test/fixtures/users.ts        # mockUser(), mockSession(), mockProfile(), mockAuthContext()
src/test/fixtures/listings.ts     # Listing fixtures
src/test/fixtures/memberships.ts  # Membership tier fixtures
src/test/helpers/render.tsx       # createHookWrapper(), renderWithProviders()
src/test/helpers/supabase-mock.ts # createSupabaseMock(), emptyResponse(), errorResponse()
```

### Running tests

```bash
npm run test              # Vitest unit + integration (watch mode)
npm run test:coverage     # With coverage report
npm run test:e2e          # Playwright E2E
npm run test:e2e:headed   # Playwright with browser visible
```

### Coverage thresholds (enforced in CI)
- Statements: 25%
- Branches: 25%
- Functions: 30%
- Lines: 25%

## Key Architectural Decisions

> Full decisions log: `docs/PROJECT-HUB.md` → KEY DECISIONS LOG  
> Archived decisions: `docs/DECISIONS.md`

Key active decisions agents must respect:
- **DEC-011:** Native mobile via Capacitor (not React Native) — after PWA validates demand
- **DEC-014:** Executive Dashboard is `/executive-dashboard` standalone page, not an admin tab
- **DEC-015:** Seed data system is DEV-only, production-guarded
- **DEC-020:** Text Chat Agent supersedes Phase 10 Track D AI Support Agent
- **Voice quota:** Tier-based (not flat) — Free 5/day, Plus/Pro 25/day, Premium/Business unlimited

---

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Never push directly to `main`
- ❌ Never commit with failing tests
- ❌ Never ship new business logic without corresponding tests (see Tests-With-Features Policy)
- ❌ Never hardcode business metrics without verifying against docs
- ❌ Never update GitHub Issues priority — that's the human's job
- ❌ Never skip updating flow manifests when adding routes
- ❌ Never use placeholder content or fake statistics
- ❌ Never modify production Supabase (xzfllqndrlmhclqfybew) without explicit human confirmation
