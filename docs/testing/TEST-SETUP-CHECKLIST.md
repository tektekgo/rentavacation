## 🎯 OVERVIEW

This checklist guides you through setting up a complete testing infrastructure for Rent-A-Vacation. Follow in order - each step builds on the previous.

**Progress Tracking:** Mark items as you complete them.

## ⚙️ PHASE 0: Pre-Setup (30 minutes)

**Goal:** Create accounts and gather credentials

### Step 1: Percy.io Account
- [ ] Go to https://percy.io
- [ ] Click "Sign in with Google"
- [ ] Connect to GitHub repository: `tektekgo/rentavacation`
- [ ] Copy Percy token from Project Settings
- [ ] Note: Private repos ARE supported on free tier

### Step 2: GitHub Repository Prep
- [ ] Ensure you have push access to `tektekgo/rentavacation`
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions is enabled (Settings → Actions)
- [ ] Check current workflow files in `.github/workflows/`

### Step 3: Local Development Setup
- [ ] Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/tektekgo/rentavacation.git`
- [ ] Verify local setup works: `npm install && npm run dev`
- [ ] Confirm Supabase connection (check console for errors)

---

## 📦 PHASE 1: Install Testing Tools (45 minutes)

**Goal:** Add Vitest, Playwright, and supporting libraries

### Step 4: Install Vitest (Unit + Integration)
```bash
npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui @vitest/coverage-v8
npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
npm install -D jsdom
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Run `npx vitest --version` → Should show version number
- [ ] Check `package.json` has vitest in devDependencies

### Step 5: Install Playwright (E2E)
```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install # Downloads browser binaries
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Run `npx playwright --version` → Should show version number
- [ ] Confirm browsers installed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Step 6: Install Percy for Visual Regression
```bash
npm install -D @percy/cli @percy/playwright
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Run `npx percy --version` → Should show version number

### Step 7: Update package.json Scripts
Add these to `package.json` scripts section:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
    "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed",
    "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
    "test:visual": "percy exec -- playwright test"
  }
}
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Run `npm run test` → Should start Vitest (will fail, no tests yet)
- [ ] Run `npm run test:e2e` → Should start Playwright (will fail, no tests yet)

---

## 🛠️ PHASE 2: Configure Testing Tools (1 hour)

**Goal:** Setup configuration files for optimal testing

### Step 8: Create vitest.config.ts
```bash
# Use Claude Code with PROMPT 1 from CLAUDE-CODE-PROMPTS.md
```

**What to create:**
- [ ] `vitest.config.ts` in project root
- [ ] Configure test environment: jsdom
- [ ] Setup coverage settings (60% threshold)
- [ ] Configure test globals
- [ ] Add path aliases (@/ → src/)

**Verification:**
- [ ] Run `npm run test` → Should not error (just "no tests found")
- [ ] Config file has proper TypeScript types

### Step 9: Create playwright.config.ts
```bash
# Use Claude Code with PROMPT 1 from CLAUDE-CODE-PROMPTS.md
```

**What to create:**
- [ ] `playwright.config.ts` in project root
- [ ] Configure browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Set base URL: http://localhost:5173 (dev server)
- [ ] Configure test directory: tests/e2e/
- [ ] Set timeout: 30 seconds
- [ ] Enable screenshots on failure
- [ ] Enable video on retry

**Verification:**
- [ ] Run `npm run test:e2e` → Should not error (just "no tests found")
- [ ] Config file has proper TypeScript types

### Step 10: Create Test Setup Files
Create directory structure:
```
tests/
├── setup.ts           # Global test setup (Vitest)
├── fixtures/          # Test data
│   ├── users.ts
│   ├── properties.ts
│   └── bookings.ts
├── helpers/           # Test utilities
│   ├── supabase.ts   # Supabase test client
│   └── auth.ts       # Auth helpers
├── unit/              # Unit tests
├── integration/       # Integration tests
└── e2e/               # E2E tests
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Directory structure created
- [ ] setup.ts exports proper test utilities

### Step 11: Setup Test Environment Variables
Create `.env.test` file:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://oukbxqnlxnkainnligfz.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[DEV_ANON_KEY]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[YOUR_TEST_KEY]
RESEND_API_KEY=re_test_[YOUR_TEST_KEY]
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] `.env.test` exists
- [ ] Added to `.gitignore` (don't commit secrets!)
- [ ] Test keys are Stripe TEST mode (not live)

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Tests are slow" (>5 min)
**Fix:**
- Run tests in parallel (default in Vitest/Playwright)
- Use GitHub Actions caching for node_modules
- Split E2E tests into smaller suites

### "Tests are flaky"
**Fix:**
- Add proper wait conditions (waitForSelector, etc.)
- Don't rely on exact timing (setTimeout)
- Clean up test data properly

### "Coverage is dropping"
**Fix:**
- Enable pre-commit hooks to check coverage
- Add tests for new code before merging
- Review untested code paths

### "CI is failing but local tests pass"
**Fix:**
- Check environment variables match
- Ensure database state is clean between tests
- Verify browser versions match locally vs CI
