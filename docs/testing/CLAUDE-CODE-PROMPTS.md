- Profile auto-creation via database trigger

FILES TO TEST:
- src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
- src/hooks/useAuth.ts
- Auth pages: src/pages/Login.tsx, src/pages/Signup.tsx

TEST REQUIREMENTS:
1. Unit tests for AuthContext (mock Supabase client)
2. Integration tests for auth flows:
   - User signup with email/password
   - User login with email/password
   - Google OAuth (mock OAuth flow)
   - Session persistence
   - Sign out
3. RBAC tests:

## 💳 PROMPT 3: Booking & Payment Tests

**When to use:** Testing critical revenue path

**Copy this prompt:**

```
I need tests for the booking and payment flow, which is the most critical part of my platform.

CONTEXT:

- Edge function: supabase/functions/create-booking-checkout/index.ts
- Webhook handler: supabase/functions/verify-booking-payment/index.ts
- Database tables: bookings, booking_confirmations, listings
- React Query hooks in: src/hooks/ (if any booking-specific hooks exist)

CRITICAL FLOWS TO TEST:
1. Stripe checkout session creation
   - Valid listing + dates → creates session
   - Invalid dates → fails gracefully
   - Sold out listing → shows error
2. Payment webhook processing
   - Valid webhook signature → updates booking status
   - Invalid signature → rejects request
   - Duplicate webhook → idempotent handling
3. Booking confirmation
   - Booking record created with correct data
   - Escrow status set to 'pending_confirmation'
   - Confirmation email sent to traveler
   - booking_confirmation record created
4. E2E booking flow
   - User browses listing
   - Selects dates
   - Clicks "Book Now"
   - Completes Stripe checkout (use test mode)
   - Sees confirmation page
   - Booking appears in dashboard

MOCKING STRATEGY:
- Mock Stripe API calls (use stripe-mock or fixtures)
- Mock email sending (Resend API)
- Use test database for integration tests

Create comprehensive tests with error handling coverage.

3. Listing display
   - Listing cards show correct information
   - Images load properly
   - Resort badges display (if available)
   - Click listing → navigates to detail page
4. Edge cases
   - No results found → shows appropriate message
   - Invalid location → suggests corrections
   - Invalid dates (past dates) → shows error

FILES TO TEST:
