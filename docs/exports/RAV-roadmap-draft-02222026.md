## 1. Executive Summary

### The Problem

The vacation ownership (timeshare) industry is valued at $10.5 billion, yet owners of unused weeks have no efficient, trusted marketplace to monetize them. Existing options are fragmented — classified ads, Facebook groups, or legacy resale sites — with no pricing transparency, no buyer protection, and no tools for owners to manage their inventory. Meanwhile, travelers looking for vacation club properties have no way to discover available weeks, negotiate pricing, or book with confidence.

### The Solution

Rent-A-Vacation (RAV) is a peer-to-peer vacation rental marketplace purpose-built for vacation club and timeshare owners. The platform creates a two-sided marketplace where owners list unused timeshare weeks and travelers discover, negotiate, and book vacation rentals — with transparent per-night pricing, a bidding engine that lets travelers propose their own terms, and trust infrastructure that protects both sides of every transaction.

The platform is feature-complete for MVP across 19 completed development phases, with 306 automated tests passing, zero type errors, and zero lint errors. All 21 database migrations and 17 edge functions are deployed to both development and production environments.

**Key differentiators:**
- **Two-Sided Marketplace with Real-Time Negotiation:** Travelers can book at listed prices, bid their own price ("Name Your Price"), propose different dates, or post wish lists ("Vacation Wishes") that owners compete to fulfill. Owners see live demand signals — matching travel request count and max budget — while creating listings. Auto-matching connects newly approved listings with open traveler requests.
- **Traveler-Friendly Pricing:** Per-night rate transparency (not lump-sum), flexible date proposals that auto-compute from nightly rate, and AI-powered fair value analysis so travelers know if a price is competitive.
- **Owner-Centric Tools:** Full business intelligence suite ("Owner's Edge") with earnings tracking against maintenance fee targets, pricing recommendations based on comparable accepted bids, bid activity feed, and idle week alerts — giving owners the data they need to maximize returns on their unused weeks.
- **Trust & Payment Protection:** Escrow system holds funds until the traveler physically checks in and confirms the stay. Owner verification with progressive trust levels (New → Verified → Trusted → Premium). Admin-controlled approval workflows for both users and listings. 4 cancellation policy tiers.
- **AI-Enhanced Search (Voice + Text):** Voice concierge and text chat assistant provide natural language property search as an additional discovery channel — complementing the traditional search, filter, and browse experience.

## 8. Current Roadmap — Planned (Detail)

### 8.1 Phase 20: Accounting, Tax & Fee Framework

**Priority:** Required before public launch (Phases A + B). As a marketplace facilitator in 43+ US states, RAV must collect and remit occupancy/sales taxes before processing real transactions.

**Reference:** `docs/RAV-PRICING-TAXES-ACCOUNTING.md`

| Sub-Phase | Scope | Est. Time | Timeline |
|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **A: Fee Breakdown** | Separate fee line items on bookings: nightly rate, service fee, cleaning fee, tax. Price breakdown display on PropertyDetail and Checkout pages. | 4–6h | Pre-launch |
| **B: Stripe Tax Integration** | Auto-calculated occupancy + sales tax at checkout based on property location. Tax line item stored on booking records. | 6–8h | Pre-launch |
| **C: Admin Tax Reporting** | Tax collected report by jurisdiction and month. Owner payout summary. Platform revenue report (service fees only). | 4–6h | Pre-launch |
| **D: QuickBooks Integration** | Sync Stripe transactions → QuickBooks Online via API. Automated revenue recognition and owner payout reconciliation. | 8–12h | Post-launch |
| **E: 1099-K Compliance** | Track owner earnings (>$600/year threshold). Generate 1099-K forms. Owner tax info collection (W-9). | 4–8h | Before Jan 2027 |
| **F: Automated Tax Filing** | Avalara or TaxJar integration for auto-filing per jurisdiction. Quarterly remittance reports. | 8–16h | When volume justifies |

> **Context:** Stripe processing fees (~2.9%) are absorbed by RAV within the 15% service fee margin. The platform commission rate (15% default) is admin-configurable. Pro owners pay 13% (−2%), Business owners pay 10% (−5%).

### 8.2 SEO Optimization

**Priority:** Recommended before public launch for organic discovery.

| Task | Description | Est. Time | Status |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Per-page meta tags** | Install `react-helmet-async`, create `SEOHead` component, add unique title/description to all 15+ public routes | 3–4h | Planned |
| **Sitemap.xml** | Static sitemap with all public routes, add reference in robots.txt | 30min | Planned |
| **Page-level JSON-LD** | FAQPage on `/faq`, WebApplication on `/calculator`, Product/Offer on `/property/:id`, BreadcrumbList on all pages, SearchAction for site search | 2–3h | Planned |
| **Image optimization** | Add `loading="lazy"` + `decoding="async"` to all images, WebP format with fallbacks, responsive `srcset` | 2–3h | Planned |
| **Route-based code splitting** | Convert static imports to `React.lazy()` in App.tsx for smaller initial bundle and faster FCP | 1–2h | Planned |
| **Dynamic og:image** | Property-specific Open Graph images when sharing `/property/:id` on social media | 1h | Planned |
| **404 noindex** | Add `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` to NotFound.tsx | 5min | Planned |

**What's already built (SEO):**

| Feature | Status | Details |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Homepage meta tags | BUILT | Title, description, og:*, twitter:* in `index.html` |
| Organization JSON-LD | BUILT | Schema.org markup with social links in `index.html` |

| PWA manifest | BUILT | Full manifest in `vite.config.ts` — name, icons, categories |
| Favicons | BUILT | ico + png icons for all platforms |
| Alt text on images | BUILT | ~95% coverage across 23 images |

> **SEO docs:** Planning documentation exists at `docs/features/seo-optimization/00-PROJECT-BRIEF.md` and `docs/features/seo-optimization/01-SESSION1-TASK.md` with implementation checklists and code examples.

### 8.3 Security Hardening

**Priority:** Recommended before public launch.

| Task | Description | Est. Time | Status |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Content Security Policy** | Add CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, HSTS headers via `vercel.json` | 2h | Planned |
| **Rate limiting (payment)** | Add per-IP rate limiting to `create-booking-checkout` and `send-email` edge functions (same pattern as voice/text-chat) | 2–3h | Planned |
| **Tighten CORS** | Checkout endpoint currently uses `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` — restrict to production domain whitelist | 30min | Planned |
| **Error monitoring** | Sentry integration for frontend + edge function error tracking, source map uploads | 2–3h | Planned |
| **Analytics** | Google Analytics 4 or Plausible for page views, events, conversion tracking | 1–2h | Planned |

| Row Level Security (all database tables) | BUILT |
| Admin approval workflow (user + listing) | BUILT |
| Staff Only Mode (3-layer enforcement) | BUILT |
| Terms of Service + Privacy Policy pages | BUILT |

### 8.4 Phase 21: Partial-Week Booking

**Priority:** Backlog — consider after date proposals validate demand

Enables travelers to book a subset of an owner's listed dates (e.g., 6 of 8 days). Requires per-night pricing (Phase 19 ✅), listing splits, per-split escrow, and handling of cleaning gaps and minimum stay rules. Estimated 20–30 hours. Deferred until demand validates the pattern through Phase 19's flexible date negotiation.

- Owner "flexible dates" flag on listings
- Calendar subset selection for travelers
- Listing splits (booked portion + remaining days become new listing)
- Per-segment escrow, confirmation, and payout
- Edge cases: cleaning gaps, minimum stay, resort check-in days

### 8.5 Voice & Mobile Roadmap

| Phase | Scope | Prerequisites | Est. Time |
|-------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Voice Everywhere (Phase 3)** | Voice-assisted listing creation, booking flows, and bidding negotiations | Voice Tracks C-D ✅ | 3–4 weeks |
| **Native Mobile — Track A** | Capacitor setup + build pipeline | PWA validates demand | ~2 days |
| **Native Mobile — Track B** | Push notifications, camera access, biometric auth | Track A | ~1 week |
| **Native Mobile — Track C** | App Store publishing (Google Play + Apple App Store) | Track B | ~1 week |
| **Native Mobile — Track D** | CI/CD for mobile builds | Track C | ~2–3 days |

### 8.6 Phase 6: Advanced Features (Q3 2026)

- Saved searches & search alerts
- Advanced filtering (map view, amenity search)
- Owner analytics and performance insights
- Calendar integration (Google Calendar, iCal)

---

## 9. Ideas Backlog (Unscheduled)
