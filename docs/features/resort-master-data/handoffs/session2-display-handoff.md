## Post-Session 2: PROD Data Import

After Session 2, the deployed site (rent-a-vacation.com) showed 0 resorts because the Vercel deployment points to PROD Supabase, but data had only been imported to DEV.

**Fix applied:**
- Linked Supabase CLI to PROD (`xzfllqndrlmhclqfybew`)
- Ran `npx supabase db push` to apply migration to PROD
- Ran import script with PROD service role key
- Verified: 117 resorts + 351 unit types imported, all counts PASS
- Re-linked Supabase CLI back to DEV

**Environment mapping:**
| Environment | Supabase Project | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Local dev (`.env.local`) | rentavacation-DEV (`oukbxqnlxnkainnligfz`) | Data imported |
| Vercel (rent-a-vacation.com) | rentavacation-PROD (`xzfllqndrlmhclqfybew`) | Data imported |
