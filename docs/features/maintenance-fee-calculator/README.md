## What This Feature Does

A free, public-facing web tool that timeshare owners find via Google Search.
They enter their resort brand, unit type, and annual maintenance fees — the
calculator shows exactly how many rental weeks they need to break even and
what they could earn listing on RAV.

Primary purpose: **SEO lead generation.** Owners find it on Google, see their
earnings potential, click "Create Free Owner Account."

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|

| Income estimates | Static lookup table | Sufficient accuracy, no API cost |
| Calculation | Pure frontend, live update | No submit button, instant feedback |
| Social proof count | Supabase unauthenticated query | Real number builds trust |
| Migration | None | Pure frontend, no DB changes |

## Income Estimates Reference

Built-in lookup table — 9 brands × 4 unit types = 36 data points.
