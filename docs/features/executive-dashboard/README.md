# Executive Dashboard — Feature README

**Access:** `rav_owner` role only  
**Phase:** 14  
**Status:** 🟡 In Development  
**Created:** February 20, 2026

## What This Is

A premium, investor-grade strategic dashboard for the RAV Owner. Designed to impress VCs and provide real business intelligence. Completely separate from the Admin Command Center in design language and purpose.

**The story it tells:** "We've built infrastructure that can scale, in a market nobody has properly served."

## Proprietary Metrics (RAV-specific)

These metrics exist ONLY because RAV has a bidding model. No competitor can show them.

- **RAV Marketplace Liquidity Score™** — composite health index (0–100)
- **RAV Bid Spread Index™** — price discovery health over time
- **Voice vs Traditional Conversion Funnel** — unique to RAV's voice AI adoption

---

## Data Tiers

- **Tier 1:** Always live from Supabase (no external APIs)
- **Tier 2:** Live from free APIs (NewsAPI, FRED — no cost)
- **Tier 3:** BYOK — Demo Mode by default, unlocked with user-supplied API key

## Key Decisions

| ID | Decision |
|----|---------|
| DEC-014 | Separate `/executive-dashboard` route (not a tab in admin) |
| DEC-015 | "Demo Mode / Connected" BYOK pattern |
| DEC-016 | NewsAPI free tier via Edge Function with 60-min cache |
| DEC-017 | Dark-first theme (not Tailwind dark: variants) |

---

## Running the Demo Seed

```bash
# Populate DEV database with coherent demo data
npx ts-node scripts/seed-executive-demo.ts

# Expected output: 47 users, 22 bookings, $102,600 GMV
```

---

## Edge Functions

| Function | Purpose | API Key Required |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `fetch-industry-news` | NewsAPI + Google News RSS | NEWSAPI_KEY secret |
| `fetch-macro-indicators` | FRED consumer confidence data | None (public) |
| `fetch-airdna-data` | Market comp data | BYOK — user supplied |
| `fetch-str-data` | STR benchmark data | BYOK — user supplied |
