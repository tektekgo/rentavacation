## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Docker not running" error during Agent 2**
**Solution:** Start Docker Desktop, wait for it to initialize, retry deployment

### **"VAPI assistant not responding" during Agent 3**
**Solution:** Check VAPI dashboard logs, verify assistant ID in `.env.local`

### **"No microphone permission" during testing**
**Solution:** Browser settings → Allow microphone for localhost

### **"Empty search results" in all tests**
**Solution:** Expected! Database is empty. Mock data is optional.
