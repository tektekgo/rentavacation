**Failed:** 3 (fixed during QA)
**Skipped:** 2 (require physical device / screen reader hardware)

---

## Test Results by Category

### 1. Static Analysis

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| TypeScript compilation (`tsc --noEmit`) | PASS | Zero errors |
| Production build (`npm run build`) | PASS | 20.87s, bundle 1,836 kB |
| No console errors in voice files | PASS | Only expected warnings |

**Build Warning (non-blocking):** Bundle exceeds 500 kB due to VAPI SDK. Consider code-splitting with dynamic `import()` post-launch.

---

### 2. Edge Function API Tests

| Test | Request | Status | Response |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| 2.1 Basic search | `{"destination":"Maui"}` | PASS | `{"success":true,"results":[],"total_count":0}` |
| 2.2 Empty body | `{}` | PASS | `{"success":true,"results":[],"total_count":0}` |
| 2.3 Invalid JSON | `invalid json` | PASS | `{"success":false,"error":"...not valid JSON"}` |
| 2.4 Full filters | destination+dates+price+bedrooms+amenities | PASS | All params echoed in `search_params` |
| 2.5 CORS preflight | OPTIONS request | PASS | `200 OK`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` |
| 2.6 VAPI webhook format | `{"message":{"type":"function-call",...}}` | PASS | Correctly unwraps nested params |

**Note:** All searches return 0 results (empty database) -- this is expected for beta.

---

### 3. Code Review - Types (`src/types/voice.ts`)

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Types match Edge Function response | PASS | `location`, `brand`, `sleeps` correctly used |
| Schema difference documented | PASS | Clear comment explaining brief vs actual DB |
| All status values covered | PASS | `"idle" | "listening" | "processing" | "success" | "error"` |

---

### 4. Code Review - Hook (`src/hooks/useVoiceSearch.ts`)

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| VAPI SDK initialization | PASS | Guards against missing public key |
| Event listeners registered | PASS | `call-start`, `call-end`, `message`, `error` |
| Cleanup on unmount | PASS | `vapi.stop()` + ref cleanup |
| Error handling (start failure) | PASS | Catches and sets error state |
| Error handling (Edge Function failure) | PASS | Try/catch with user-friendly message |
| Transcript capture | PASS | Filters for `final` + `user` role |
| Function call detection | PASS | Checks `search_properties` name |
| Status persistence after call end | PASS | Keeps `"success"` so results stay |

**Concerns (non-blocking for beta):**
- No `AbortController` on the Edge Function fetch -- if user stops mid-search, the fetch continues. Results could arrive after state reset. Low risk for beta.
- No timeout on Edge Function call -- could theoretically hang. Supabase has its own timeouts (60s default).
- Hook runs even when feature flag is off (React rules of hooks require this). The internal `useEffect` exits early if key is missing, so impact is minimal.

---

### 5. Code Review - VoiceSearchButton (`src/components/VoiceSearchButton.tsx`)

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Idle state rendering | PASS | Outline button + Mic icon + tooltip |
| Listening state rendering | PASS | Destructive button + MicOff + pulsing dot |
| Processing state rendering | PASS | Loader2 spinner + disabled |
| `aria-label` on all states | PASS | "Voice Search", "Stop voice search", "Processing search" |
| Tooltip on idle button | PASS | "Voice Search" tooltip |
| Button disabled during processing | PASS | `disabled={isProcessing}` |
| Keyboard activation | PASS | Standard `<button>` -- Enter/Space work by default |

---

### 6. Code Review - VoiceStatusIndicator (`src/components/VoiceStatusIndicator.tsx`)

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Idle state hidden | PASS | Returns null |
| Listening state display | PASS | Pulsing mic + "Listening..." |
| Processing state display | PASS | Spinner + "Searching properties..." |
| Success state display | **FIXED** | Was rendering "0" when resultCount=0 |
| Error state display | PASS | Destructive alert + error message |
| Dismiss button | PASS | X button with aria-label="Dismiss" |
| Screen reader announcement | **FIXED** | Added `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` |

---

### 7. Code Review - Rentals Page Integration (`src/pages/Rentals.tsx`)

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Feature flag gates voice UI | PASS | `voiceEnabled` checks on button and status |
| Voice button placement | PASS | Next to Search button |
| Status indicator placement | PASS | Below search bar, inside card |
| Voice results section | PASS | Above main listings, with separator |
| Voice result cards display | PASS | Name, location, brand, dates, price, sleeps |
| Grid/list view modes | PASS | Both supported for voice results |
| Image fallback | PASS | MapPin placeholder when image_url is null |
| Brand formatting | PASS | Underscores replaced with spaces |

**Note:** Voice result cards are not clickable (no `<Link>`) -- intentional for beta since voice results use UUID IDs from the actual DB, while existing property pages use sequential mock IDs.

---

### 8. Code Review - Edge Function (`supabase/functions/voice-search/index.ts`)

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| CORS handling | PASS | Preflight + response headers |
| Dual input format | PASS | Direct API + VAPI webhook |
| DB query construction | PASS | Listings JOIN properties |
| Database-level filters | PASS | Price, dates, status |
| Application-level filters | PASS | Destination, bedrooms, brand, sleeps, amenities |
| Error handling | PASS | Try/catch + structured error response |
| Logging | PASS | `[VOICE-SEARCH]` prefix for all steps |
| Result limiting | PASS | Max 20 results |
| `open_for_bidding` handled | PASS | Accepted but ignored (not in DB) |
| `flexible_dates` handled | PASS | Skips date filters when true |

**Concerns (non-blocking for beta):**
- All errors return HTTP 400 (DB errors should be 500)
- No rate limiting
- CORS wildcard `*` -- tighten for production

---

### 9. Environment Configuration

| Variable | Set | Value Correct | Notes |
|----------|-----|---------------|-------|
| `VITE_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY` | **FIXED** | Yes (after fix) | Was missing `pk_` prefix |
| `VITE_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID` | Yes | Yes | `af9159c9-d480-42c4-ad20-9b38431531e7` |
| `VITE_FEATURE_VOICE_ENABLED` | Yes | Yes | `true` |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Yes | DEV instance |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | Yes | DEV anon key |

---

### 10. Accessibility Audit

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Keyboard navigation (Tab to button) | PASS | Standard button element |
| Keyboard activation (Enter/Space) | PASS | Default button behavior |
| ARIA labels on button states | PASS | All three states labeled |
| Screen reader announcements | **FIXED** | Added `aria-live="polite"` to status indicator |
| Dismiss button accessible | PASS | `aria-label="Dismiss"` |
| Color contrast (button) | PASS | Uses themed `destructive` and `outline` variants |
| Focus visible indicator | PASS | Default Tailwind/shadcn focus ring |
| Keyboard shortcut (Escape to stop) | NOT IMPL | Low priority for beta |

**Skipped:** Full screen reader testing (NVDA/JAWS) requires manual verification with hardware.

---

### 11. Security Review

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| VAPI public key exposure | PASS | Public keys are designed for client-side use |
| Supabase anon key exposure | PASS | Anon keys are designed for client-side use |
| Service role key protected | PASS | Only in Edge Function env, not in frontend |
| No XSS vectors | PASS | React auto-escapes, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` |
| No injection in Edge Function | PASS | Supabase client parameterizes queries |
| `.env.local` in `.gitignore` | **CHECK** | Verify before committing |

---

### 12. Feature Flag Test

| Scenario | Expected | Result |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `VITE_FEATURE_VOICE_ENABLED=true` | Voice button visible | PASS (code review confirms conditional rendering) |
| `VITE_FEATURE_VOICE_ENABLED=false` | Voice button hidden | PASS (code review confirms) |
| Variable missing | Voice button hidden | PASS (`=== "true"` check fails for undefined) |

---

### 13. Browser Compatibility (Code-Level Assessment)

| Browser | Expected | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Chrome | PASS | Full WebRTC + MediaDevices support |
| Firefox | PASS | Full WebRTC support |
| Edge | PASS | Chromium-based, same as Chrome |
| Safari | CAUTION | WebRTC generally works but may have quirks with VAPI SDK |

**Note:** Actual browser testing requires manual verification by running the dev server in each browser.

---

### 14. Mobile Responsiveness (Code-Level Assessment)

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Button size (icon button) | PASS | `size="icon"` = minimum 36x36px touch target |
| Status indicator overflow | PASS | Alert component is responsive |
| Voice results grid | PASS | `md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` responsive grid |
| Search bar layout | PASS | `md:grid-cols-4` stacks on mobile |

**Note:** Actual mobile testing requires physical device or Chrome DevTools emulation.

---

### 15. Performance (Code-Level Assessment)

| Metric | Expected | Assessment |
|--------|----------|------------|
| VAPI session startup | < 2s | Depends on VAPI cloud latency (not measurable in code review) |
| Edge Function response | < 1s | Curl tests showed ~300-500ms (empty DB) |
| Memory leaks | LOW RISK | Hook cleanup calls `vapi.stop()` + nulls ref |
| Bundle impact | ~400 kB | VAPI SDK adds significant weight; consider lazy loading |

---

## Bugs Found & Fixed

### Fixed During QA (3 bugs)

#### Bug #1: Zero results renders "0" text (HIGH)

**File:** `src/components/VoiceStatusIndicator.tsx:52`
**Severity:** High
**Issue:** When `resultCount` is `0`, `{resultCount && resultCount > 0 ? ... : ...}` short-circuits to `0`, which React renders as the literal text "0" instead of the "No results found" message.
**Fix:** Changed to `{resultCount != null && resultCount > 0 ? ... : ...}`
**Status:** FIXED

#### Bug #2: Missing ARIA live region (HIGH)

**File:** `src/components/VoiceStatusIndicator.tsx:24`
**Severity:** High
**Issue:** Status changes (listening -> processing -> success) were not announced to screen readers.
**Fix:** Added `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` to the Alert component.
**Status:** FIXED

#### Bug #3: VAPI public key missing `pk_` prefix (MEDIUM)

**File:** `.env.local:2`
**Severity:** Medium (would be Critical if untested, but .env.local is developer-specific)
**Issue:** Key was `152f910f-c138-4496-b29a-8334a100ed04` instead of `pk_152f910f-c138-4496-b29a-8334a100ed04`. VAPI SDK expects the `pk_` prefix.
**Fix:** Added `pk_` prefix.
**Status:** FIXED

### Open Issues (Non-blocking for Beta)

#### Issue #4: No AbortController on Edge Function fetch (LOW)

**File:** `src/hooks/useVoiceSearch.ts:73`
**Severity:** Low
**Issue:** If user stops voice search while Edge Function call is in flight, the fetch continues and could update state after reset.
**Recommendation:** Add AbortController in Phase 2.

#### Issue #5: Voice result cards not clickable (LOW)

**File:** `src/pages/Rentals.tsx:295-352`
**Severity:** Low
**Issue:** Voice results use `<div>` not `<Link>`. Users can't click through to property details.
**Recommendation:** Wire up links when property detail pages support UUID-based routing.

#### Issue #6: Bundle size warning (LOW)

**Severity:** Low
**Issue:** Production bundle is 1,836 kB (VAPI SDK contributes ~400 kB).
**Recommendation:** Lazy-load the voice search hook and components with `React.lazy()` + `Suspense`.

#### Issue #7: CORS wildcard in Edge Function (LOW)

**File:** `supabase/functions/voice-search/index.ts:5`
**Severity:** Low
**Issue:** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` allows any origin.
**Recommendation:** Restrict to production domain(s) before full launch.

#### Issue #8: No rate limiting on Edge Function (LOW)

**Severity:** Low
**Issue:** No request rate limiting. Could be abused.
**Recommendation:** Add Supabase rate limiting or edge middleware in Phase 2.

## Known Issues from Previous Agents (Verified)

| Issue | Source | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Empty database (0 results) | All agents | EXPECTED | No listings data in DEV. Not a bug. |
| Price drift ("$1500" vs "$2000") | Agent 1 | MONITOR | LLM may confuse "cheap=$1500" guideline with user price. Monitor post-launch. |
| Deepgram transcription quality | Agent 1 | KNOWN | Fragmented/hesitant speech garbled. Acceptable for beta. |
| Duplicate function calls | Agent 1 | KNOWN | Possible race condition. Low impact. |
| `open_for_bidding` not in DB | Agent 2 | BY DESIGN | Param accepted but silently ignored. |
| `property_type` -> `brand` mapping | Agent 2 | BY DESIGN | Partial string match. May need refinement with real data. |
| VAPI server URL not configured | Agent 3 | VERIFY | Check VAPI dashboard has Edge Function URL for server-side calls. |
| Dual Edge Function calls | Agent 3 | BY DESIGN | Frontend + VAPI both call Edge Function for reliability. |

## Production Readiness

**Recommendation:** Deploy with Monitoring

**Reasoning:**

The voice search implementation is solid from a code quality perspective:
- Clean TypeScript with zero compilation errors
- Proper error handling at every layer (VAPI SDK, Edge Function, frontend)
- Good separation of concerns (types, hook, components)
- Feature flag provides instant kill switch
- Edge Function handles both direct API and VAPI webhook formats

Three bugs were found and fixed during QA:
1. Zero results rendering bug (would display "0" text)
2. Missing ARIA live region (screen readers wouldn't announce status changes)
3. VAPI public key prefix mismatch (would prevent VAPI initialization)

**Conditions for Production Deployment:**

1. **Required:** Deploy Edge Function to PROD Supabase (`xzfllqndrlmhclqfybew`)
2. **Required:** Set production env vars (VAPI keys, Supabase PROD URL/key)
3. **Required:** Update VAPI assistant server URL to point to PROD Edge Function
4. **Required:** Manual E2E test with real microphone (at minimum in Chrome)
5. **Recommended:** Manual test in Firefox and Edge
6. **Recommended:** Test on one mobile device (iOS or Android)
7. **Recommended:** Set up basic error logging before enabling for all users

---

## Post-Launch Monitoring Plan

**Week 1:**
- Monitor VAPI usage via VAPI dashboard (calls/day, error rate)
- Check Supabase Edge Function logs for errors
- Watch for user-reported issues
- Verify voice search works with real listing data (once DB is populated)

**Week 2-4:**
- Analyze voice query patterns (common destinations, filter usage)
- Identify UX pain points (e.g., users not knowing how to stop)
- Monitor Deepgram transcription quality with real users
- Track conversion: voice search -> property view -> booking

**Phase 2 Recommendations:**
1. Lazy-load VAPI SDK to reduce initial bundle size
2. Add AbortController to Edge Function fetch
3. Make voice result cards clickable (link to property detail)
4. Add rate limiting to Edge Function
5. Restrict CORS to production domain(s)
6. Add voice search usage analytics
7. Implement voice listing creation for property owners
