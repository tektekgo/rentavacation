## INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI AGENTS

**Read this section before making any changes to PROJECT-HUB.md**

### What This File Is For (and What It's NOT For)

**This file is for:**
- KEY DECISIONS LOG (DEC-XXX entries)
- Architecture notes and technical decisions
- Session handoff context
- Known issues and blocked items

**This file is NOT for:**
- Task tracking → use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rent-a-vacation/rav-website/issues)
- Priority ordering → use [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/rent-a-vacation/rav-website/milestones)
- Board view → use [RAV Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/rent-a-vacation/projects/1)
- Completed phase details → use [COMPLETED-PHASES.md](COMPLETED-PHASES.md)

### GitHub Issues Workflow (see CLAUDE.md for full details)

**At START of every session:**
```bash
gh issue list --repo rent-a-vacation/rav-website --state open --label "pre-launch"
```

**At END of every session:**
```bash
# Close completed issues with summary
gh issue close <number> --repo rent-a-vacation/rav-website --comment "Completed: [summary]"

# Create issues for anything discovered
gh issue create --repo rent-a-vacation/rav-website --title "..." --label "..." --body "..."
```

### When to Update This File

**ALWAYS update at the END of your session if you:**
- Make an architectural decision (add to KEY DECISIONS LOG)
- Discover a known issue or blocker
- Need to pass context to the next session

### Decision Logging
**When you make a technical or product decision:**
1. Add it to "KEY DECISIONS LOG" section
2. Use format: DEC-XXX (next sequential number)
3. Include: Date, Decision, Rationale, Status

**Decisions Log archival → `docs/DECISIONS.md`**
- When a decision is 1+ month old and status is final, move it to `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- Leave a one-line entry: `- DEC-XXX: [title] → [details](DECISIONS.md#dec-xxx)`
- Keep recent/pending decisions inline

### What NOT to Do
- Don't track tasks here — use GitHub Issues
- Don't update priority queues here — use GitHub Milestones
- Don't delete information (move to COMPLETED-PHASES.md or DECISIONS.md)
- Don't skip updating "Last Updated" date at the bottom

## CURRENT STATUS

> **Task tracking has moved to GitHub Issues.** See [open issues](https://github.com/rent-a-vacation/rav-website/issues) and the [RAV Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/rent-a-vacation/projects/1) board.

### Quick Links
- **Open issues:** `gh issue list --repo rent-a-vacation/rav-website --state open`
- **Pre-launch issues:** `gh issue list --repo rent-a-vacation/rav-website --state open --label "pre-launch"`
- **Project board:** https://github.com/orgs/rent-a-vacation/projects/1

### Open Milestones
> See [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/rent-a-vacation/rav-website/milestones) for the current list. Do not duplicate here.

### Known Issues
- **PropertyDetail/Checkout dates are read-only** — By design for timeshare listings (owner sets fixed dates), but users may expect date selection.
- **VAPI overrides limited** — Transcriber (nova-3), keyword boosts, and speaking plans cause 400 errors via SDK overrides. Must configure in VAPI dashboard Advanced tab.
- Edge functions require `--no-verify-jwt` deployment flag

### Platform Status
- **451 automated tests** (63 test files, all passing), 0 type errors, 0 lint errors, build clean
- **Migrations deployed:** 001-035 on DEV, 001-023 on PROD
- **Edge functions deployed:** 25 on DEV, 22 on PROD
- **PROD platform:** locked (Staff Only Mode enabled)
- **Supabase CLI:** currently linked to DEV
- **dev branch:** 2 commits ahead of main

## COMPLETED PHASES

> Full details for all completed phases: [COMPLETED-PHASES.md](COMPLETED-PHASES.md)

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 19: Flexible Date Booking + Per-Night Pricing</strong> — Completed Feb 22, 2026</summary>

**What:** Switch platform to per-night pricing, add flexible date proposals on bids, and "Inspired By" travel requests from listing detail.

**3 Tracks:**
- **Per-Night Pricing:** Migration 020 adds `nightly_rate` column to listings (backfilled from `owner_price / nights`). Shared `src/lib/pricing.ts` utility replaces 4 duplicated `calculateNights()` functions. All displays (Rentals, PropertyDetail, Checkout, FeaturedResorts, MyListingsTable, PricingIntelligence) use DB `nightly_rate`. Owner listing form switched from "Your Asking Price" to "Nightly Rate" with live price summary (nights x rate, RAV fee, traveler total).
- **Option A — Propose Different Dates:** BidFormDialog gains `mode` prop (`'bid'` | `'date-proposal'`). Date-proposal mode shows date pickers with auto-computed bid amount (`nightly_rate x proposed nights`). `listing_bids` gets `requested_check_in/out` columns. BidsManagerDialog shows proposed dates in blue badge. "Propose Different Dates" button on PropertyDetail.
- **Option B — Inspired Travel Request:** `InspiredTravelRequestDialog` pre-fills TravelRequestForm with listing's location, dates, bedrooms, brand. "Send to this owner first" toggle (`target_owner_only`). `travel_requests` gets `source_listing_id` + `target_owner_only` columns. "Request Similar Dates" button on PropertyDetail.

**Database:** Migration `020_flexible_dates_nightly_pricing.sql` — 3 ALTER TABLEs + backfill + constraint
**New Files:** `src/lib/pricing.ts`, `src/lib/pricing.test.ts`, `src/components/bidding/InspiredTravelRequestDialog.tsx`, `src/components/bidding/BidFormDialog.test.tsx`
**Modified:** ~20 files (types, hooks, components, pages, seed manager, flow manifests, email)
**Tests:** 289 total (16 new), 0 type errors, 0 lint errors, build clean
</details>

<details>

- **Layer 2 (Inventory):** 10 properties (2 per owner, real resort names), 30 listings (15 active, 10 bidding, 5 draft)
- **Layer 3 (Transactions):** 50 renters with growth curve (8→16→26 over 90 days), 90 completed bookings, 10 pending, 5 in escrow, 5 cancellations, 20 bids, 10 travel requests, 8 proposals

**Database:** Migration `015_seed_foundation_flag.sql` — `is_seed_foundation` boolean column on profiles with partial index
**Edge Function:** `seed-manager` with 3 actions: `status` (table counts), `reseed` (full 3-layer creation), `restore-user` (recreate deleted accounts)
**Admin UI:** `DevTools.tsx` — 4 sections (status grid, reseed with log, test accounts table, Stripe test cards). Conditional tab in AdminDashboard (DEV only)
**Safety:** Production guard (`IS_DEV_ENVIRONMENT` secret), protected set (foundation + RAV team members), FK-ordered 21-table deletion

## RESEARCH SPIKES

### RS-001: LiveKit Voice Agents SDK Evaluation
**Date Added:** February 15, 2026
**Status:** Closed — Decision made (DEC-012: Stay on VAPI)
**Resolution:** Cost savings from LiveKit don't justify 3-6 weeks of engineering at current scale (~$300-700/month voice spend). Revisit when monthly voice spend consistently exceeds $3,000/month.

---

### DEC-004: Content Management Strategy
**Date:** February 13, 2026
**Status:** Pending

**Options:**
- A: Manual hardcode in components (fast, not scalable)
- B: Custom CMS in admin panel (4-6 hours build)
- C: Third-party CMS like Sanity (learning curve)

**Next Step:** Build prototype admin content panel, evaluate effort vs benefit

---

### DEC-009: AI Support Agent Strategy
**Date:** February 15, 2026
**Decision:** TBD — Needs design decision
**Status:** Pending

**Context:** Site-wide link audit revealed "Contact Support" buttons were non-functional. Contact form implemented as interim (Track C). AI-powered support agent is the long-term goal.

**Options:**
- A: Simple contact form only — **implemented as interim**
- B: Rule-based chatbot from FAQ content
- C: AI chat widget (Anthropic API)
- D: VAPI voice support agent
- E: LiveKit voice agent (see DEC-010, RS-001)
- F: Hybrid (contact form now + AI agent later) — likely best approach

**Next Step:** Complete RS-001 research spike, then decide AI approach

---

### DEC-014: Separate Route for Executive Dashboard
**Date:** February 20, 2026
**Decision:** `/executive-dashboard` as standalone page, not a tab in admin dashboard
**Status:** Final

**Reasoning:** Different design language, different audience, different purpose. Admin = utilitarian ops tool. Executive = boardroom strategy view. Mixing them dilutes both.

---

### DEC-015: Demo Mode / Connected Pattern for BYOK
**Date:** February 20, 2026
**Decision:** Default to "Demo Mode" with sample data, toggle to "Connected" with user-supplied API key
**Status:** Final

**Reasoning:** Honest to VCs (not faking data), shows product capability, real feature for future enterprise customers, avoids paying $200-500/mo for APIs before product-market fit.

---

### DEC-016: NewsAPI for Industry Feed
**Date:** February 20, 2026
**Decision:** Use NewsAPI free tier (100 req/day) via Edge Function with 60-min cache
**Status:** Final

**Reasoning:** Free, reliable, sufficient volume for demo + early production use. Cache in Edge Function memory to stay within limits.

---

### DEC-017: Dark Theme Approach
**Date:** February 20, 2026
**Decision:** Build dark-first (not using Tailwind dark: variants), wrap page root in bg-slate-900
**Status:** Final

**Reasoning:** Cleaner implementation, avoids fighting with app's light theme, more reliable visual consistency for demo.

---

### DEC-020: Text Chat Agent — Two-Tier Conversational Model
**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Decision:** Add OpenRouter-powered text chat alongside existing VAPI voice, as completely separate systems
**Status:** Final

**Context:** Voice search (VAPI) is expensive, tier-gated, and not always practical. Users need a conversational alternative that's universally available.

**Reasoning:** (1) OpenRouter is 10-100x cheaper than VAPI per interaction — no quota needed. (2) Text chat works in all environments (noisy, mobile, accessibility). (3) Shared `_shared/property-search.ts` module avoids code duplication while keeping systems independent. (4) VAPI remains untouched — zero regression risk. (5) Context-based system prompts (rentals/property-detail/bidding/general) provide relevant help across pages. (6) SSE streaming gives natural token-by-token display. (7) Session-only persistence avoids migration — can add localStorage/DB persistence later.

---

### DEC-018: Pre-Launch Platform Lock Strategy
**Date:** February 20, 2026
**Decision:** System-settings-based "Staff Only Mode" toggle (not per-user blocking)
**Status:** Final

**Context:** Need to prevent external users from creating test data on PROD before launch, while still deploying all code to PROD.

**Reasoning:** A global toggle in `system_settings` is simpler than per-user blocking. Leverages existing `can_access_platform()` RLS function. Toggle is in Admin > System Settings — flip it off when ready to go live. Default: enabled (locked). Enforced at 3 layers: database RLS, Login.tsx, Signup.tsx.

---

### DEC-019: Seed Data Management Approach
**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Decision:** 3-layer edge-function-based seed system with foundation user protection
**Status:** Final

**Context:** DEV environment needs realistic test data for functional testing and executive demos. PROD is locked via Staff Only Mode.

**Reasoning:** Edge function approach (vs raw SQL) allows: (1) idempotent auth.admin.createUser for proper trigger-based user setup, (2) production guard via env variable, (3) admin UI integration for one-click reset, (4) protected set pattern to never wipe RAV team or foundation accounts. Foundation users survive reseeds; everything else is disposable.

---

### DEC-021: Search Bar & Filter Strategy
**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Decision:** Make Rentals page search bar, calendar picker, and filter panel fully functional with state management and query integration
**Status:** Approved

**Context:** Comprehensive audit revealed the Rentals page search bar is mostly placeholder UI. Calendar picker is a static `<Input>`, Search button has no handler, and filter panel inputs (price/guests/bedrooms/brand) have no state bindings. Only the location text input works.

**Approach:** Wire all controls to React state, integrate with listing query filters. Calendar uses existing shadcn/ui `Calendar` component + `Popover`. Dates filter listings at application level (matching `_shared/property-search.ts` approach). PropertyDetail/Checkout dates remain read-only (timeshare model = owner sets fixed availability windows).

---

### DEC-022: Pricing, Tax & Accounting Framework
**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Date Updated:** February 28, 2026
**Decision:** Per-night pricing + separated fee line items + Stripe Tax before launch + Puzzle.io post-launch (pluggable)
**Status:** Approved (Updated — Puzzle.io replaces QuickBooks)
**Docs:** `docs/RAV-PRICING-TAXES-ACCOUNTING.md`

**Context:** Platform uses per-night pricing with itemized fee breakdown. As a marketplace facilitator in 43+ US states, RAV must collect and remit occupancy/sales taxes before going live. Accounting tool re-evaluated Feb 28 — Puzzle.io selected over QuickBooks for native Stripe integration, free tier, and automated revenue recognition (ASC 606).

**Key decisions:**
- Per-night rate (`nightly_rate`) is the atomic pricing unit across the platform ✅
- Fee breakdown: separate `service_fee`, `cleaning_fee`, `tax_amount` line items on every booking ✅
- Stripe Tax for automated tax calculation at checkout (code ready, pending #127) 🟡
- **Puzzle.io** as general ledger (replaces QuickBooks) — native Stripe sync, free <$20K/mo, automated revenue recognition
- **Pluggable accounting architecture** — provider-agnostic adapter pattern; can swap to QuickBooks/Xero/Zoho via config
- 1099-K handled natively by **Stripe Connect** ($2.99/form) — no Gusto needed
- Resort fees are owner-disclosed, not RAV-collected (paid at resort check-in)
- Stripe processing fees (~2.9%) absorbed by RAV, baked into 15% service fee margin

### DEC-023: Flexible Date Booking Strategy
**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Decision:** Three-phase approach — Option A (bid with dates) → Option B (inspired-by request) → Option C (partial-week splits)
**Status:** Approved

**Context:** Current model requires travelers to book the full date block set by the owner. This limits conversion when a traveler wants 6 of an 8-day listing.

**Approach:** Start with lightweight "Propose Different Dates" button (reuses existing bidding infrastructure, adds date fields to bids). Follow up with "Inspired By" travel requests (pre-filled from a listing, targeted to that owner). Defer full partial-week splitting until demand validates the pattern.

### DEC-011: Mobile App Strategy
**Date:** February 15, 2026
**Decision:** PWA first (Phase 11), then Capacitor native shells (Phase 12)
**Status:** Approved

**Approach:** Two-phase — PWA (1-2 days) validates mobile demand, then Capacitor (2-3 weeks) for Google Play + Apple App Store from one codebase.

**Reasoning:** Existing React + Vite + Tailwind is Capacitor-ready. All hooks, components, Supabase integration carry over. React Native rewrite not justified at current scale.

**Requirements:** Apple Developer Account ($99/yr), Google Play Console ($25 one-time), Mac for iOS builds
