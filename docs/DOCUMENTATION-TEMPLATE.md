├── handoffs/                   # Session completion summaries
│   └── sessionX-handoff.md
├── KNOWN-ISSUES.md             # Bugs, tech debt for this feature
└── README.md                   # Quick start, testing, links
```

**Template for PROJECT-BRIEF.md:**

## 🚀 PROJECT STARTUP CHECKLIST

**When starting a NEW project:**

- [ ] Create `docs/` folder
- [ ] Copy PROJECT-HUB.md template
- [ ] Create ARCHITECTURE.md (can be minimal at start)
- [ ] Create SETUP.md (even if simple)
- [ ] Create DEPLOYMENT.md (even if just "TODO")
- [ ] Create `docs/features/` folder
- [ ] Create `docs/guides/` folder
- [ ] Create NEW-CHAT-TEMPLATE.md
- [ ] Customize PROJECT-HUB.md for your project
- [ ] Commit initial docs structure
- [ ] Start building!

---

## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Single Source of Truth
**PROJECT-HUB.md is the GPS.** Everything else is detail.

### 2. Living Documentation
**Update docs as you work,** not after. Stale docs are worse than no docs.

### 3. Minimal but Complete
**Include what's needed,** nothing more. If it doesn't help you, delete it.

### 4. Context Travels in Files
**Not in chat history.** Handoffs and PROJECT-HUB.md carry context between sessions.

### 5. Consistency Across Projects
**Use this structure for EVERY project.** Muscle memory = efficiency.

## 📊 DECISION FRAMEWORK

**When to document a decision:**
- ✅ Architectural choice (database, framework, etc.)
- ✅ Product direction (feature priority, UX approach)
- ✅ Trade-off made (performance vs simplicity)
- ✅ Anything you might revisit later

**Decision template:**
```
### DEC-XXX: [Title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Decision:** What was decided
**Reasoning:** Why this choice
**Alternatives Considered:** What else was an option
**Trade-offs:** What we gave up
**Status:** ✅ Final / 🟡 Pending / 🔴 Revisit
```

---

## 🎯 PHASE COMPLETION TEMPLATE

**When finishing a phase:**

```
### Phase X: [Name] ✅
**Completed:** [Date]
**Status:** LIVE in production
**Docs:** docs/features/[name]/

**Delivered:**
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

**Impact:**
- [Metric]: [Change]
- [Metric]: [Change]

**Known Issues:**
- [Issue] - See docs/features/[name]/KNOWN-ISSUES.md
```

---

## 🔧 MAINTENANCE

**Keep docs healthy:**
- 🟢 **Green:** Updated within 7 days
- 🟡 **Yellow:** Updated within 30 days
- 🔴 **Red:** Older than 30 days → needs update

**Review quarterly:**
- Are all docs current?
- Can we archive anything?
- Do new devs understand them?
- Are templates still relevant?

---
