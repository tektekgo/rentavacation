## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "The microphone icon is grayed out / disabled"

**Check:**
1. **Are you logged in?** Voice search requires an account. Sign in first.
2. **Is your account approved?** New accounts need admin approval (usually within 24 hours). Check your email for an approval notification.
3. **Have you used all your daily searches?** Each user gets 10/day. Check the quota badge — if it says "0 remaining", try again tomorrow or use manual text search.

### "Voice search isn't working"

**Check:**
1. Microphone permission is allowed
2. Browser supports voice (Chrome, Safari, Edge work best)
3. Internet connection is stable
4. Microphone is not muted

**Still having issues?**
- Try manual search (type instead)
- Contact support
- Check system audio settings

### "It didn't understand me"

**Try:**
- Speaking more slowly
- Rephrasing your search
- Being more specific
- Reducing background noise

### "I want to switch back to typing"

Just use the regular search box! Voice is optional, always available.
